# Data Science Project
By Muhammad Sanaullah KAYANI, Ifechukwu EJIOFOR, and Yizhou MA

## Project Goal
This project has three parts:

COMPAS scores have been shown to have biases against certain racial groups. Analyze the dataset to highlight these biases.

Based on the features in the COMPAS dataset, train classifiers to predict who will re-offend. Study if your classifiers are more or less fair than the COMPAS classifier.

Build a fair classifier.
